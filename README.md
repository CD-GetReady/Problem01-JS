Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to n on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Wu" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Tang" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "WuTangForever" instead of the number.

Before you get started make sure to install the needed modules in node by running "node i"

Then to run the unit test use the command "npm test"
